                Artificial Intelligence, commonly called AI, is the branch of computer science that deals with building machines and systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning from experience, problem-solving, decision-making, speech recognition, language translation, and visual perception.
                <br>
                AI works through techniques such as machine learning, where computers are trained with data to make predictions or decisions, and deep learning, which uses networks modeled after the human brain to analyze complex patterns. Because of these methods, AI is able to continuously improve its performance over time.
                <br>
                In today's world, AI has found applications in almost every field. In healthcare, it assists in diagnosing diseases and developing treatment plans. In education, AI powers personalized learning platforms. In transportation, it is used in self-driving cars. In business, AI chatbots and recommendation systems enhance customer experience, while in finance, it helps detect fraud and manage risks.
                <br>
                Despite these benefits, AI also raises challenges. Issues of job displacement, privacy, bias in decision-making, and ethical use remain important discussions. The future of AI depends not only on technological progress but also on how humans regulate and guide its use responsibly.
                <br>
                In conclusion, Artificial Intelligence is one of the most transformative technologies of our time. If developed wisely, it can greatly improve the quality of human life, but it requires careful oversight to ensure that it serves humanity positively.
